# lunch-and-learn: Meet your best friend the Dev Tools âœ¨

-We are going to learn about a very important tool called DevTools
-Will be applicable to all.

-story about myself as a designer, visual learner
 
-Learning the DevTools is a gateway into learning front-end web development.

## Goal of this L&L:
- How the DevTools will help you with your day-to-day jobs / navigating
- Learn a few basic rules around HTML & CSS
- How to manipulate content and styling (HTML & CSS) right in the browser
- Accessibility features (AAA b)

## Why should we learn the Dev Tools?
For developers, using DevTools you can know the styles that are used, the size of the images, the scripts that are used, etc. You can debug and know what errors exist on the page. You can even toggle styles on or off, or change them completely, to see what effect it has on your website.

- QA-ing website designs and content
- Quick way to prototype 
- Performing performance and accessibility audits
- Deubugging

## What is HTML & CSS?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the content of a webpage made-up of semantic block elements.
- Semantic HTML blocks

## HTML Attributes
- class names
```HTML
 <h2 class="cool"></h2>

## Explore the following:

### HTML
